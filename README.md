## What is Sweat Mate?
Sweat Mate (need to find a better name) is a web app that allows gym rats to create personal profiles, create workout sessions, and match with other gym rats who have matching sessions.

It is also a great app for people to socialize more with the gym community. Users can create their own communities, create meetups, and post photos from their gym sessions.

(Still building the app, so stay tuned!)
